We are still finalizing our idea, but what we intend to do is to create a social networking site that allows multiple users to read and discuss a book together.

This is inspired by the cool way of envisioning a book Ken Perlin showed us in the NYU trip in 2012. We will be playing around with JavaScript and different features to allow users to be able to view a book in different ways, leave notes in certain pages, create discussions, link to certain pages, etc.

Group Members 
* Helen Nie: leader
* David Kurkovskiy
* Dina Levy-Lambert
* Shreya Kalva

As we work out the roles involves, we will update this doc. We hope to use the concepts we've been learning this term (MVC, higher order functions, etc.) to be able to envision reading a book in a new and more modern way.
